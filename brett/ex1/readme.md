Brett's Solutions to HW1

Doing these in C++ to practice C++. It would have been simpler to use python,
awk, sed, etc to do many of these. This is just for practice!

Part 1
  get_low_frequency_words: outputs by line words that occur less than 5 times.
  replace_low_frequency_words: given an input file, and an input file of words to replace, outputs
                               the input file with the words in the replacement set replaced with 
                               _RARE_.
Part 2
  simple_tagger: for a given input file, and a given input file of test data, outputs tagged data.
